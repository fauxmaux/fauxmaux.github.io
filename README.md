You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/fauxmaux/fauxmaux.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/fauxmaux/fauxmaux.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

An **experiment** is an investigation in which a hypothesis is scientifically tested. In an experiment, an independent variable (the cause) is manipulated and the dependent variable (the effect) is measured; any extraneous variables are controlled.

A **laboratory** experiment is an experiment conducted under highly controlled conditions, where accurate measurements are possible. Innovation research has developed a wide range of methodological approaches. Laboratory experiments are a fruitful methodological complement to existing methods of innovation research. The benefits and limitations of laboratory experiments, modelling the futuristic life-cycle of different areas of innovation policy, namely intellectual property rights, financial instruments, payment systems, IT development trends. Thus, laboratory experiments can fruitfully complement established methods of innovation research and provide novel empirical evidence by creating and analysing alternative scenarios.

**Empirical research** is defined as any research where conclusions of the study is strictly drawn from concretely empirical, and therefore “verifiable” evidence. This empirical evidence can be gathered using quantitative and qualitative research methods.

Attention to **artificial intelligence**, machine learning puts value on designing ideas for implementation, use and good exploitation. It is also driving innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing and cognitive computing, image recognition, personalisation of marketing campaigns, genomics and self-driving car navigation. We aim to provide the curious with a checklist of these innovative techniques, with best practices, and a pedagogy to sensitise the indifferents.

It is a huge responsibility to educate, teach and guide others. With the right methods, we can give wings, but we can also break those wings, possibly causing a lifetime of breakage, injury, psychological trauma. The history of mankind reflects the gradual change of this programming system. In a real-life comparison with a person from an "uncivilized" tribe, we can see that the difference lies in the different educational program. **Education** is therefore one of the most important activities of humanity.
**Pedagogy** is the process of shaping and developing the individual. In this process it teaches:
- to know reality and thus to take possession of the world,
- and to transform it for his own benefit and for the benefit of the humanity,
- the means, forms and methods of relating,
- the world of values, orienting the development of the value system,
- to imagine and create the new, according to the latest values and technologies, and research findings.

This programme is pursued by the **Experimental Laboratory of Artificial Inetlligence** using programming languages, microcontrollers, robotics, artificial intelligence and the transfer of empirical results, in this way **learning by teaching others** and playing together.
